Hello!

Welcome to the companion github for the R workshop. Here we will post any alternative codes or exercises to help expand and enrich your R knowledge. 

If you come across helpful tips or codes as you learn, please feel free to send it to us and we will happily add them here! Or better yet, start your own github!

Why start your own github you may ask? It's a helpful way to back up any code or syntax you are using for different projects. Check it out!

If you try the code here and find that it isn't working, please let us know so that we can troubleshoot with you/ fix the code!


That's all! Happy coding :)
