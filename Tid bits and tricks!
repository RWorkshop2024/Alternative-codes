## Welcome to the tid bits and tricks file where I include... well tid bits and tricks ##

1. R Hot keys
  Hot keys are a nice way of speeding up your coding process
  There are a whole host of keys: https://support.posit.co/hc/en-us/articles/200711853-Keyboard-Shortcuts-in-the-RStudio-IDE
  below I only include the ones that you will probably use the most.
  Note that use Command instead of Control for Mac's

HoT KeYz:
  Alt + - to make the <- symbol
  Crtl + Shift + M to make the %>% symbol (for piping)
  Crtl + Enter will run your code line
  Crtl + D will delete your code line
  Crtl + Shift + Left or Right arrow to select a word (use Option instead of Control for Macs)

2. Find and Replace
  An excellent tool if you want to copy code you've previously used but don't want to hand type each dataset or variable name

3. Console doesn't save D:<
  R Console *will not save*. One trick is you can paste your console output to a text document either via Notepad, or open one up in R:
  - Click on the new file icon (the one you click on to open a new script)
  - Select Text File as one of the options
  For descriptive tables, don't hand calculate your percentages! Drop the needed numbers into excel and go from there!

4. Specific codes that might be useful
  Here are some small bits of code that might help you out for specific scenarios. I'll likely add to this list as we come up against some issues.

Reseting rownames---
  It might happen that you will remove subjects from your dataframe (removing test subjects for example). When you do this, the row numbers
  (as seen when you look at View(dataframe_name)) will be missing numbers. For example, you want to remove subjects in row 3 and 5. When
  you do so, this is what happens:
  1  bark
  2  quack
  4  moo
  6  meow
  Oops- this is no good- if you index later on, you will run into problems. We would like it to look like:
  1  bark
  2  quack
  3  moo
  4  meow
  Use the following code to refresh the row numbers:
  rownames(dataframe_name) <- NULL

Quickly converting values into NA---
  Sometimes you have data where NA is given a specific code like -99, -97, -98 or whatever it is. While maybe helpful in SPSS, this is less useful in R
  We want these values to be registered as NA in R. To do so, here is one approach:
    data$variable[data$variable=="-97"] <- NA
    data$variable[data$variable=="-98"] <- NA
    data$variable[data$variable=="-99"] <- NA
  There are multiple ways of doing this, but this is one way. If your variable is numeric, a fast way of getting the job done:
    data$variable[data$variable < 0] <- NA

Working with dates---
  Dates can be tricky in R. Before you can do manipulation, the first step is to make sure that the date variable is formatted correctly.
  R will have a default order that it likes its dates in- you will see this order when you look at the date variable via View(data)
  Let's say R likes its dates formatted like: Day-Month-Year. Here is how we can make sure our date is actually formatted correctly:
    data$variable_date <- as.Date(data$variable_date, format=c("%d-%m-%Y"))
  A quick google will give you details on formatting dates in R :)

Error in formatting a variable---
  Made a formatting error? Convert the variable to a character, and R should let go of any formatting you made.
    data$variable <- as.character(data$variable)
  If this doesn't work... sorry to say, you will have to reload the dataset and start again. (This is why I recommend doing initial trials on a test copy
  to make sure whatever you are trying out works!)
